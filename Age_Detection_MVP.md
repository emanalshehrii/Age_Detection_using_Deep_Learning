# Age Detection using Deep Learning

## Objective

- The main objective of this project is to use deep learning algorithms in order to estimate the age from facial image.

## Building Simple Neural Network

- As seen above, five sequential layers were added with "relu" activation function for simple NN as a baseline model, each layer has a different no. of neurons, started from 512 and the output layer is 8 classes.

## Future Work
- Build CNN model using pre-trained data such as VGG16.
