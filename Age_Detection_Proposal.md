# Age Detection Proposal

## Overview

Recently, many applications using biometrics to extract information from face images such as age, gender, and emotional state. 
So, in this project we're going to use facial features analysis to estimate the age. The main objective of this project is to use deep-learning algorithms in order to estimate the age from facial image.

## Data Description
- In this project we choose the [UTKFace dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jangedoo/utkface-new) from Kaggle.
- The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity.

## Tools
**The tools we will use in our project:**
- python, and Jupyter Notebook.

**The python libraries:**
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- Tensorflow
