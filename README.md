# Age Detection Proposal

## Overview

Recently, many applications using biometrics to extract information from face images such as age, gender, and emotional state. 
So, in this project we're going to use facial features analysis to estimate the age. The main objective of this project is to use deep-learning algorithms in order to estimate the age from facial image.

## Data Description
- In this project we choose the [Indian Movie Face database](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/faces-age-detection-dataset) from Kaggle.
- This dataset contains 19906 images. The attributes of data are **ID** â€“ Unique ID of image and **Class**  Age bin of person in image.
## Tools
**The tools we will use in our project:**
- python, and Jupyter Notebook.

**The python libraries:**
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- Tensorflow
